# Neural_Network

## Overview of the Analysis:
The intent of the project is to utilize Machine Learning and Neural Networks to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This is by using the features in the dataset which helped create a binary classifier. 
The data was from Alphabet Soup's business team, a csv file containing more tham 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Aplhabet Soup over the years. Some of the columns that captures metadata about each organization such as EIN, NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, ORGANIZATION and 8 other columns. 
The steps taken to predict are as follows,
*  Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
*  Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
*  Optimize the Model
